      <p> Car Island has a handful of attractions but due to it being a smaller island off the coast of Japan, you may think it doesn't have a lot. Despite that fact, it has a kind population of people and cats to show you around the island.</p>
      <h2> The Cats </h2>
      <p>This is cat Island, there are plenty of friendly cats that you can always go through and pet, if you just simply sit around, you can be surrounded by cats in minutes.</p>
